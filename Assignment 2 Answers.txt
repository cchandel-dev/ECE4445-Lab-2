a)

function thres = intermeans_9(im)

%Implements a intermeans algorithm and computes a threshold for binarizing an image

 

 

thres = round(uint8(mean2(im)));

thres_prev = thres + 1;

 

while thres_prev ~= thres

    thres_prev = thres;

    [h,D]=imhist(im);

    meanLo = sum(D(1:thres_prev).*h(1:thres_prev))/sum(h(1:thres_prev));

    meanHi = sum(D(double(thres_prev+1):max(D)+1).*h(double(thres_prev)+1:max(D)+1))/sum(h(double(thres_prev+1):max(D)+1));

    thres = round(( meanLo + meanHi ) / 2);

end

 

thres = thres/max((D));

 

 

 

b) thres = 0.5137

 

c) Graylevels associated with the rice grains that are near the bottom of the picture are lower than the defined threshold - it may seem like the rice grains are relatively "white" due to stark contrast with the darker background, but they have lower grayscale values than the threshold

 

d)

>> max(bwlabel(bw),[],'all')

The total number of grain counted by MATLAB is 151

 

e)

you need to write a brief summary for bwareaopen()

>> bw2 = bwareaopen(bw, 5);

>> max(bwlabel(bw2), [], 'all')

The total number of grain counted using bwlabel function after noices being eliminated is 97
